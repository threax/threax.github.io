	<h1>Welcome to Threax Software</h1>
	<p>My name is Andrew Piper. I have many projects, some are open source and others are intended to be in the future.</p>
	<div class="jumbotron">
		<h1>Anomalous Medical</h1>
		<p>Anomalous Medical is a 3d human anatomy simulation program. It features stunning 3d anatomy and an accurate simulation of the movement of the mandible.</p>

	<div class="jumbotron">
		<h1>Personal Cloud</h1>
		<p>I have made apps for home automation, voice recognition using a Kinect, note taking, shopping lists, budgeting and file access. User management is handled by the Threax.IdServer project. These apps can be deployed in a variety of ways. There is a reference server setup using Docker on Linux, but Windows and IIS also works great.</p>
		<p>This project is still in the early stages and has not been open sourced, but it is created with the open source Threax Hypermedia Framework described below.</p></div>
	<div class="jumbotron">
		<h1>Edity McEditface</h1>
		<p>Edity McEditface is a silly name for a different kind of CMS. I threw away the common assumptions for these systems, which typically involve a web application serving up pages, which can lead to security issues and hackers trying to exploit them. The sites created with this app are just static content files that are easy to host anywhere. Changes and edits are tracked using Git and you can even publish to a separate Git repository. You can run it either as a local application or host it on a server depending on your needs.</p>
		<p>Both this website and Anomalous Medical&#39;s were created with this tool and are hosted on github for free.</p>

		<h1>Threax Hypermedia Framework</h1>
		<p>The Threax Hypermedia Framework is a collection of libraries and services that help to build microservices/microapps based on HATEOAS&nbsp;using ASP.Net Core. This uses a centralized identity server for user management and interapp communication. It also features a large amount of automation to build models, clients and even user interfaces.</p>

	<div class="jumbotron">
		<h1>HtmlRapier</h1>
		<p>HtmlRapier is a lightweight web front end framework written in typescript. This library has 3 major control types: views, forms and toggles. Views provide a display area for a particular set of data based on templates written into the html. Forms provide read/write access to data. Toggles make it possible to alter the current classes, styles and disabled status of HtmlElements. All of this is tied together with controller classes that can subscribe to html events. There is also a dependency injection system that is based on function prototypes instead of strings. This can be used to build front end code that keeps the developer in control with a high amount of component reusability.</p>

	<div class="jumbotron">
		<h1>Threax.IdServer</h1>
		<p>This is a reference implementation of the identity management microservice. It uses IdentityServer4 to provide Open ID Connect capabilities, which is used to log into the individual apps. This version comes with user types for both internally defined users in the id server and applications. Either of these can log in in a unified way to individual apps, which greatly simplifies user management. This project also has an app dashboard that is used to define the applications in the id server using metadata from the deployed apps.</p>

	<div class="jumbotron">
		<h1>Threax.AspNetCore.Template</h1>
		<p>This template is the basic implementation of an app in my architecture. It shows off the major features and can be modified to build real applications. The HATEOAS apis drive the front end, customizing it to the current user&#39;s needs and permissions. Users are managed with the Identity Server, which the app will connect to using the client generated from the id server. Finally the model generator is installed, which can be used to add new data and remove the built in example data. This template allows for rapid prototyping of apps by reusing as much code as possible, however, each component can be customized as much as needed to deliver the desired functionality.</p>
